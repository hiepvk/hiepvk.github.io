And if it's already too late for you to escape certain death, there may still be time to save your loved ones - just tap an alert to share it.\n\nSecret Locations\nYou can quit pestering my Maker because there's not one but two brand new secret locations for you to track down. (This brings the grand total to 60!)\n\nAlternate App Icon\nGet in the holiday spirit with my festive new alternate app icon, \"Now I Have A Machine Gun\".\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\n- The Infograph \u201ctop text\u201d complication is now available on California watch faces - just set the style to something other than \"snark\" to activate.\n- Siri watch face cards now open directly to the Watch app when you tap on them.\n- Snow accumulations for Dark Sky's day summaries are available again.\n\nAnd because I ran out of coal, I also tossed in a bunch of bug fixes and performance improvements as stocking stuffers. Happy holidays, you filthy animals.\n\nxoxo,\nCARROT",

The bug also happens when you try to play multi-sources of sound at the same time. Enable Legacy PiP is a workaround. Note that Legacy PiP removes UHD quality and breaks the default video quality feature of uYou. Use it at your own risk!",
